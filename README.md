# Semantic annotation of news articles

This program helps you annotate news article with [semantic triples][triples] such as
`(Jean Charest, works_for, McCarthy Tétrault)` from articles like [these][jchired],
`(Pierre Renaud, was_president_of, BAPE)`, `(Pierre Renaud, works_for, McCarthy Tétrault)` and
`(Pierre Renaud, helps, Mining Industry)` from [there][prbape], and so on.

The development of this program is, I hope, one step in the direction of fulfilling the promise of
semantic web, which is the organic emergence of collective intelligence, but since that goal is way
too broad and far away, I have a more immediate goal: Efficiently establish the existence of 
[revolving doors][revolving] in politics.

Of course, I'm not naive enough to think I could develop a program that would find these all by
itself. That would mean deep natural language parsing and understanding, and it would almost need
an artificial intelligence to achieve.

Humans will still drive the revolving door hunting process, but (the way I envision this) as the
human adds annotations that machines can understand better than text, the program knows better and
better where to find data to feed the human detective with, thus making his job much easier.

I'm not sure at all where I'm heading with this, but I'm trying anyway.
